# RCA 301 Emulator

This is an incomplete implementation of emulator, assembler and disassembler for [RCA 301](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1288147/Rca-301.html).

Used C# for .Net and the GUI is made with WinForms.

Only a subset of the instructions and CPU registers is implemented.
But you can still load the assembly source in PrimeNumbers.asm and assemble and run it.
It uses the Tape Write Normal instruction (TWN) to print prime numbers to the output window (the upper right corner of the GUI).
